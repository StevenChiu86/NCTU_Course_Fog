After watching this seminar, I have learned more about 3 main areas of five generation network(5G) like Enhanced mobile broadband(eMBB), Massive machine-type communications(mMTC), and Ultra-reliable and low latency communications(URLLC)

## 5G Usage Scenarios

### In 5G network Phase1, it focuses on eMBB
* eMBB
    * Provide higher data-bandwidth and connection reliability via two New Radiofrequency ranges
        * Range 1 extends 4G LTE, from 6000 MHz to 6 GHz. This is mainly referred to as New Radio (NR) or sub-6GHz.
        * Range 2 is at a much higher frequency 24,250 MHz (~24GHz) to 52,600 MHz (~52GHz). This is referred to as a millimeter-wave (mmWave).

### Phase2, it focuses on mMTC
* mMTC
    *  It focuses on providing connectivity to a large number of devices whose traffic information is typically a small amount of data.
    *  Main concern is the optimal power utilization of massive devices because they are battery powered and less battery life.

### Phase3, it focuses on URLLC

* URLLC
     *  It focusses on low latency, high reliability, and high availability aspects. 
    *  It is used to apply in mission-critical use cases and applications that require less than 1 millisecond of latency and 99.9999 percent reliability.

## Frequency Bands use cases

* Low Frequency cells 700MHz
    * Internet of Things(IOT) 
* Mid Frequency 3.4-3.8 GHz
    * Vehicle to Vechicle communication
    * Smart city
* High Frequency 26 GHz
    * Large scale events

## Multi-access Edge Computing(MEC)

---

### This is the key technology in the URLLC scenario. MEC servers can help mobile devices which have some time-critical computing tasks to process tasks in a very short time.

### With MEC server, some data can be stored in the edge instead of storing in the cloud.

#### Data is cached at edge such as multi-access edge computing (MEC) server.
* MEC provides computing at the edge. 
* Cache unit stores content. 

#### This situation offers: 
* It can pre-store locally demanding data in edge memory.
* It reduces the delay in backhaul transmission and knows the preference of each region for the type of data.
* It protects personal private information.
* It increases data transmission rate.
