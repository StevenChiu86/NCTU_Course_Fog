## Migration From 4G to NSA to SA

- Due to most of people using 4G mobile phone, we can't directly build 5G SA architecture to serve people.

## RAN Evolution to 5G

- LTE to LTE with C-RAN: we can see that it centralizes BBU component in one box and use several RUs which  connect BBU to cover more coverage

- LTE with C-RAN to 5G RAN: Puting more component near user catering to various purposes of applications

- As we can see some of functions can be virtualized, that will be more convenient and easy to deploy

## Summary

### 5G key technologies
- In 5G system, there are lots of conponents virtualized that will easliy deploy and cut down the cost of infrastructure.
-  Control plane focusin on signal transfer and User plane focusing on data flowing seperating can be more flxiable deployment and be developed independently to decrease inner communication time.

### 6G
- I think we also need 6G in the future. 
- More applications will be invented in the future such as a hologram, so we still need bigger bandwidth to service future applications
