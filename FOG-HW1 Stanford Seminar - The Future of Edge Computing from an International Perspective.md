- Mainframe-terminal (1940's - c. 1980)
- Client-server (c. 1980 - c. 2005)
- Cloud computing (c. 2005 -present)

## Cloud computing
Cloud computing is used for handling heavy workloads from users. Sometimes, users' computers can not process heavy workloads without strength CPU and big storage, so users can put their data on cloud servers with stronger CPU and larger storage like Amazon and Google to handle all their works.

- Main points for cloud
    - In the early years, people do their works which don't demand some requirements like low latency and privacy. What they actually need for their work is the computer which has Strong hardware to place their data and compute some heavy workloads.
- Some represent cloud apps 
    - Email
    - Web presence
    - Business productivity
    - Collaboration
    - Virtual desktop
    - Financial management
    - Analytucs
    - CRM
    - VoIP
    - ERP
    - Call center

## Edge computing
Using Edge devices which have lower CPU and storage to deal with some light works demanding low latency, privacy requirements.

- Why do we need edge computing
    - Huge data produced from IoT is transient, so it's a good way to stay in the edge node
    - Self-driving cars need the low latency data response to handle the whole self-driving system
    - Some important data should stay in the local place to prevent hacker
    - When we handle some AI processing, Application-specific chips can be faster than multifunction processing chips in the data center 

- Main points for edge
    - Edge device is responsible for dealing light tasks and offloading some heavily tasks to cloud, so it won't replace the cloud computing which can deal with complex tasks
    - Processing at edge focus on avoiding latency and transfer data with some reasons. 
    - Some processing which need large amounts of data should computing in cloud
 
- Some use cases for edge computing
    - Wearable device
    - Smart buildings
    - Smart manufacturing
    - Self-driving vehicle
    - VR,AR
    - remote medical treatment

 ##### I think the next few years will have more applications with edge computing. There also will bring some challenges like for tasks offload management, data storage preference problems, security ...etc, so we should face them and overcome them.
