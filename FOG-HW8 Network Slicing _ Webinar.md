## What is Network Slicing
- 5G network slicing is the use of network virtualization to divide single network connections into multiple distinct virtual connections that provide different amounts of resources to different types of traffic.
### Why we need it
- It provides suitable end-to-end Qos with optimal resource sharing
- 3GPP provides three types of slices:  Mobile Broadband, Low Latency, Massive IoT
    - Each network slice has:
        - A segment of the RAN, Core network, Transport network
        - One of many service 
        - Suiltable lifecycle management


### Different cases for network slicing

- Stand Alone (SA) and Non Stand Alone (NSA) deployment

- The channel capacity for different cases
    - Network Slice for MBB
        - 100MHz Channel
    - Network Slice for V2X
        - 50MHz Channel
    - Network Slice for Iot
        - 20MHz Channel 
- Use Cases

- 5G uses software-defined networking and network functions virtualization for the partitioning of network architectures into virtual elements.
- 5G Network slicing allows network operators to have a portion of the network provide the exact features a segment of the customer base needs.
